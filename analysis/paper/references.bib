 abstract="The use of computers and complex software is pervasive in archaeology, yet their role in the analytical pipeline is rarely exposed for other researchers to inspect or reuse. This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other's work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.",

Around 50ka, dramatic growth occurred within dispersed populations that were genetically isolated from each other. Population growth began earliest in Africa and later in Eurasia and is hypothesized to have been caused by the invention and spread of a more efficient Later Stone Age/Upper Paleolithic technology, which developed in equatorial Africa. Climatic and geological evidence suggest an alternative hypothesis for Late Pleistocene population bottlenecks and releases. The last glacial period was preceded by one thousand years of the coldest temperatures of the Later Pleistocene (∼71–70ka), apparently caused by the eruption of Toba, Sumatra. Toba was the largest known explosive eruption of the Quaternary. Toba’s volcanic winter could have decimated most modern human populations, especially outside of isolated tropical refugia. Release from the bottleneck could have occurred either at the end of this hypercold phase, or 10,000 years later, at the transition from cold oxygen isotope stage 4 to warmer stage 3. The largest populations surviving through the bottleneck should have been found in the largest tropical refugia, and thus in equatorial Africa. High genetic diversity in modern Africans may thus reflect a less severe bottleneck rather than earlier population growth. Volcanic winter may have reduced populations to levels low enough for founder effects, genetic drift and local adaptations to produce rapid population differentiation. If Toba caused the bottlenecks, then modern human races may have differentiated abruptly, only 70 thousand years ago.}, number={6}, journal={Journal of Human Evolution}, author={Ambrose, Stanley H.}, year={1998}, month={Jun}, pages={623–651} }

Studies of human behavioural responses to climate change have begun to address traditional archaeological questions in new ways. Hitherto, most of these studies have focused on western Eurasia, but the question of human response to rapid climatic changes in northern Japan during the Upper Palaeolithic period opens up new perspectives.

Discussion of the cause of those changes has been restricted largely to suggestions of the arrival of new technologies, presumably from southeast Asia, without exploring their advantages for humans occupying the continent. The model outlined here proposes that during the mid-Holocene exploitation of the landscape involved significant risks, and at that time new forms of stoneworking were adopted as an aid in reducing risk. Risk was associated with environmental change, high mobility, and colonization of previously unoccupied landscapes. Archaeological evidence reveals these processes to be associated with the adoption of toolkits that minimize risk.}, number={3}, journal={Journal of World Prehistory}, author={Hiscock, Peter}, year={1994}, month={Sep}, pages={267–292} }

We review debates on three continents (Australia, India and southern Africa), and argue that depictions of them as purely symbolic items manufactured for public display are implausible. Two different mechanisms dominate recent discussions: 1) exchange of symbolically loaded artefacts as a device for constructing cultural connections and establishing access to territory/resources, and 2) microliths as portable and standardized tools that helped buffer foragers against economic risk and/or scheduling difficulties by increasing multi-functionality and tool readiness as an aid in reducing fluctuations in resource capture. We show that there is a different history and pattern to microlith use on each continent and dissimilar environmental contexts for microlith-intensive phases.

In these cases, climate has an immediate impact on human mobility, which is severely constrained during the pronounced cold/dry intervals of the Pleistocene. As high mobility becomes incompatible with the environmental limitations of extreme intervals, such as the Last Glacial Maximum, previously disparate mobile human groups aggregate and compete for limited and spatially segregated resources. During such times, regional cultural variation evolves in isolation and natural selection acts on group-level adaptations, facilitating the evolution of cohesive and cooperative social networks. The process of group selection further allows for the rapid diffusion of cultural and technological innovation and may explain the rapid diffusion of microblade technology throughout northeast Asia during the post-glacial period. While climate change does present challenges to human survival and may promote alternative adaptive strategies, rapid cultural evolution is driven primarily by group formation, between-group competition, and the mechanics of cultural transmission. The degree to which climate change mediates these interactions is the extent to which climate should be implicated in cultural evolution.}, publisher={Elsevier}, author={Barton, Loukas and Brantingham, P.

The onset of the Upper Paleolithic in China dates to ca. 35,000–30,000 years ago and is marked by the appearance of a few body decorations and well-shaped bone tools that were added to stone tool assemblages, including core-and-flake tools in North China and cobble tools in South China. The proliferation of blade assemblages in northwest China is interpreted as the cultural impact or the physical presence of bearers of blade industries from western Eurasia. The ensuing appearance of microblade assemblages in North China by 23,000–22,000 years ago reflects the use of local siliceous crystalline nodules by a population that recognized the advantages of this raw material. At that time in South China, prehistoric artisans continued to shape their stone objects from the available flat river cobbles. During the later part of the Chinese Upper Paleolithic (ca. 21,000–10,000 BP), foragers also made bone tools, antler objects, pottery, and shell tools, which laid the technological foundations for the early Neolithic period. One difficulty in this research is that human fossils are rare. Few are well dated and morphological, cultural, and biological interpretations are hotly debated. Our review attempts to facilitate the understanding of a poorly known period in Chinese archaeology and its place in human cultural evolution.}, number={1}, journal={Journal of Archaeological Research}, author={Qu, Tongli and Bar-Yosef, Ofer and Wang, Youping and Wu, Xiaohong}, year={2013}, month={Mar}, pages={1–73} }

Many of the first quantitative models of cultural evolution were modified from existing concepts in theoretical population genetics because cultural evolution has many parallels with, as well as clear differences from, genetic evolution. Furthermore, cultural and genetic evolution can interact with one another and influence both transmission and selection. This interaction requires theoretical treatments of gene–culture coevolution and dual inheritance, in addition to purely cultural evolution. In addition, cultural evolutionary theory is a natural component of studies in demography, human ecology, and many other disciplines. Here, we review the core concepts in cultural evolutionary theory as they pertain to the extension of biology through culture, focusing on cultural evolutionary applications in population genetics, ecology, and demography. For each of these disciplines, we review the theoretical literature and highlight relevant empirical studies. We also discuss the societal implications of the study of cultural evolution and of the interactions of humans with one another and with their environment.}, number={30}, journal={Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}, author={Creanza, Nicole and Kolodny, Oren and Feldman, Marcus W.}, year={2017}, month={Jul}, pages={7782–7789} }

Evolutionary approaches to this problem typically cast the causes of culture change as being either stochastic in origin, or arising from selection. Stochastic sources of change include random innovations, copying errors, drift and founder effects among dispersing groups. Selection is driven by differences in payoffs between cultural variants. Most efforts to identify these evolutionary forces in the archaeological record have relied on assessing how well the predictions from a neutral-stochastic model of cultural transmission fit a data set. Selection is inferred when the neutral-stochastic model fits poorly. A problem with this approach is that it does not test directly for the presence selection. Moreover, it does not account for the fact that both neutral-stochastic and selective forces can act at the same time on the same cultural variants. A different approach based on the Price Equation allows for the simultaneous measurement of selective and stochastic forces. This paper extends use of the Price Equation to the analysis of selective and stochastic forces operating on multiple artifact types within an assemblage. Ceramic data presented by Steele et al. (2010, Vol. 37(6): 1348–1358) from the Late Bronze Age Hittite site of Boğazköy-Hattusa, Turkey, provide an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of this model. The results suggest that selection is a dominant process driving the frequency evolution of different bowl rim types within the assemblage and that stochastic forces played little or no role. It is also clear, however, that we should be attentive to combinations of direct and indirect selective effects within assemblages consisting of multiple artifact types.}, number={12}, journal={Journal of Archaeological Science}, author={Brantingham, P.

These cultural remains, unearthed from different areas in the country and covering a long time span, will help clarify the controversy.

Based on the analysis of Chinese fossils and associated materials, in conjunction with some genetic studies, this paper aims at evaluating each of the two theories in order to stimulate more discussions.

Proboscideans likely migrated from continental East Asia to Paleo-Honshu (consisting of the present day Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu islands) and the Ryukyu islands via land bridges across the Tsushima Strait and Yonaguni Strait during the coldest periods of the Middle Pleistocene (MIS 6, 12, 16, and probably 35). However, no clear evidence of hominin arrival in the archipelago has been dated to the Middle Pleistocene. Further, land bridges connecting continental East Asia and Paleo-Honshu were not present during the period of initial major human dispersals to the Japanese Archipelago, i.e., Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 and 2. Thus, initial dispersals to Paleo-Honshu and the Ryukyus were achieved by watercraft and would have involved advanced seafaring skills.

This has often been explained as the result of an indigenous development. However, the ‘heterogenic’ character of Upper Paleolithic industries is the result of the continuing influx of modern human populations via two different routes: (1) from Siberia and (2) from southern China. Blade technology from Siberia appeared in the Korean peninsula around 35 000 BP and coexisted with core and flake stone industries carried by modern humans from southern China and Southeast Asia throughout the Upper Paleolithic. This explanation is based on the current observation of patterns of Upper Paleolithic industries in East Asia. Blade industries have been found only in the northern part of East Asia while none have been reported in southern China, although modern Homo evidently dispersed via two different routes from the Near East. The ‘North-South Model’ of Modern Homo migrations into the Korean peninsula is supported by a genetic analysis of the Y-chromosome of the modern population in this region. Continuing influx of modern human population from both origins to the peninsula can explain the consistent presence of Upper Paleolithic industries that appear heterogenic.}, number={1–2}, journal={Quaternary International}, author={Bae, Kidong}, year={2010}, month={Jan}, pages={103–112}, collection={Hominin Morphological and Behavioral Variation in Eastern Asia and Australasia: Current Perspectives} }

The blade toolkits were introduced, but did not immediately replace coexisting simplified forms of tools. Simple core and flake tool assemblages (SCFA) were dominant, and were maintained without any positive cultural or technological modifications during this period of time.

Revolutionary appearances of behavioral modernity did not occur during the early stage of the Late Paleolithic period. Efficient behavioral innovations rapidly extending across the peninsula occurred only after that period of time. The blades seem not to be regarded truly as a technological marker which normally replaced preexisting simple stone tools; the advantages of SCFA, which comprise of agile and expedient toolkits, played a key role. This implies that the Korean Mode 4 assemblage during the early stage of the Late Paleolithic does not truly represent a technocomplex breakthrough.

The puzzling lack of more standardized tools should be viewed not as a conventional cultural tradition. More diverse transmitted elements for interpreting the preferences for expedient tools among forager groups may be required.}, journal={Quaternary International}, author={Lee, Hyeong Woo}, year={2013}, month={Dec}, pages={45–58}, collection={Middle to Upper Palaeolithic biological and cultural shift in Eurasia II} }

The diversification in Late Paleolithic lithic data in Korea calls into question the utility of a unilinear model of successive cultural stages defined by cultural markers. The recent increase in the number of well-controlled archaeological record with radiometric data during MIS 3 and 2 does not support a straightforward relationship with the conventional set of chrono-typological criteria. Radiocarbon dates were examined for reliability in artifact-bearing horizons from 39 Paleolithic sites in Korea. Using high-resolution examples, this paper examines if the transition from early Late Paleolithic (Stage 1) to late Late Paleolithic (Stage 2) is defined by clear-cut discontinuities. Results are not compatible with the traditional expectation of differences in toolkit assemblages between cultural stages. It is concluded that the conventionally known cultural stages are limited for adequately representing the updated data, because of the complex tempo and the non-directional mode shown during transitions. Although distinctive and varied cultural markers are observed, there is also a considerable overlap in the lithic assemblages of different stages. The cultural shifts and diversifications show both saltational and gradualistic shifting during MIS 3 and 2. Results of this paper provide an insight for reconstructing a workable (regionally distinctive) chrono-typological framework.}, journal={Quaternary International}, author={Lee, Hyeong Woo}, year={2016}, month={Jan}, pages={44–57}, collection={Paleoenvironmental studies in the Korean Peninsula and adjacent geographic areas IV} }

However, the effects of this process on the archaeological record have been virtually ignored. Hafting affects the final typological form of tools because hafted tools are usually more extensively and intensively worked than their unhafted counterparts. Ethnoarchaeological and some recent archaeological evidence indicates that functionally equivalent but typologically diverse hafted and unhafted tools may be in use at the same site. Because hafted tools are disposed of as a consequence of the “retooling” of hafts, the context of their disposal may not be equivalent to the context of their use. But, unhafted tools appear to be disposed of more often at or near the focus of use. Indifference to the hafted/unhafted distinction then may seriously distort inferences based upon intrasite spatial analysis. It is also argued that hafting is a strategy that will be differentially employed by any social group at different sites according to circumstances, thereby contributing to interassemblage variability. Finally, some methods of analysis are suggested that will allow the typological and distributional effects of hafting and retooling to be taken into account by lithic analysts.}, number={4}, journal={American Antiquity}, author={Keeley, Lawrence H.}, year={1982}, month={Oct}, pages={798–809} }

The cultural aspects of the people from MIS 3 to MIS 2 show distinctive regional differences. The unique hunting cultures of the late Upper Pleistocene were created according to each local environment. Various kinds of spears and other implements were produced in these local areas, including tanged points, bilateral points, knife-shaped tools, and bifacial points.

Sea level changes in the Upper Pleistocene caused different patterns in human migration in this region. Land bridges at the time of lowered sea level disappeared during the period of climatic warming and could not provide any terrestrial route for human movement between two regions.

Given the archaeological examples from around the East Sea/Sea of Japan, human activity was considerably limited between countries. People of the Late Paleolithic in Korea and Japan shared and developed flake techniques, such as the blade and micro-blade techniques. During MIS 3 and MIS 2, the emergence of the Late Paleolithic in Japan was very likely influenced by the Late Paleolithic in Korea.

It is one of several significant obstacles cutting across ‘savannahstan’ (Dennell and Roebroeks, 2005), a broad swathe of herbivore-rich savannah and grassy plains that began to extend over a vast area stretching from West Africa to China with climatic cooling from at least 2.5 Ma, and a key macro-environmental context for early hominin dispersal1. However, this concept of the Red Sea Basin as a barrier should not obscure the fact that its coastal regions also hold considerable potential attractions for early human settlement, especially under climatic conditions wetter than today, including a complex tectonic and volcanic topography not unlike that of the African Rift, capable of providing localized fertility for plant and animal life, tactical opportunities for pursuit of herbivores and protection from predators (King and Bailey, 2006), along with inshore and intertidal marine resources.}, booktitle={The Evolution of Human Populations in Arabia: Paleoenvironments, Prehistory and Genetics}, publisher={Springer Netherlands}, author={Bailey, Geoff}, editor={Petraglia, Michael D. and Rose, Jeffrey I.Editors}, year={2010}, pages={15–37}, collection={Vertebrate Paleobiology and Paleoanthropology} }

Despite this, three main aspects are seldom reported: (1) use of high-precision survey techniques applied to MIS 5e RSL indicators; (2) application of modern analogs to understand the indicative meaning of MIS 5e RSL indicators; (3) estimates of the effects of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) on the MIS 5e records. In this study, we show how the three points above have been addressed in a focused study on Last Interglacial outcrops on the island of Mallorca. We measured the elevation of several RSL indicators with high-accuracy differential GPS (vertical accuracies down to 0.1m) and we established the relationship between each RSL indicator and the paleo sea level through calculation of the indicative meaning for each RSL indicator. In particular, we present a novel technique to calculate the indicative meaning of fossil beach deposits with a phase-averaged morphodynamic model (CSHORE). We show how this approach helps overcoming difficulties with the survey of the modern analogs for these indicators. Our results show that two paleo RSLs are imprinted in Mallorca at +2.9±0.8m and +11.3±1.0m. We then compare our field-based results with modelled paleo RSL, calculated from the predictions of the ice-earth coupled ANICE-SELEN model, using few different ice-sheet melting scenarios during MIS 5e. We conclude that indicative ranges can be derived from relatively simple morphodynamic models and that the comparison of field-derived and modelled RSL values is a good method to validate possible scenarios of MIS 5e sea-level variability, especially in absence of precise dating.}, journal={Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology}, author={Lorscheid, Thomas and Stocchi, Paolo and Casella, Elisa and Gómez-Pujol, Lluis and Vacchi, Matteo and Mann, Thomas and Rovere, Alessio}, year={2017}, month={May}, pages={94–107} }

By using volumetric artifact density and the frequency of retouched pieces within a given lithic assemblage, it becomes possible to identify whether these stone tools were created by residentially mobile or logistically organized foragers. The linking factor between assemblage composition and land-use strategy is that of curation within lithic assemblages as an expression of economizing behavior. This method is used to study eight sites from southeastern Italy to detect changes in adaptation during the Late Pleistocene. We compare and contrast Mousterian, Uluzzian, proto-Aurignacian and Epigravettian assemblages, and argue that the first three industries overlap considerably in terms of their technoeconomic flexibility. Epigravettian assemblages, on the other hand, display a different kind of land-use exploitation pattern than those seen in the earlier assemblages, perhaps as a response to deteriorating climatic conditions at the Last Glacial Maximum. While we discuss the implications of these patterns in the context of modern human origins, we argue that the methodology can help identify land-use patterns in other locales and periods.

Resumen
Nous proposons une nouvelle approche pour l’étude des ensembles lithiques permettant d’identifier les systèmes techno-économiques dans lesquels ils s’insèrent. Utilisant comme paramètres analytiques la densité volumétrique d’artèfacts et le rapport outils/débitage, il devient possible d’attribuer un ensemble lithique préhistorique à un mode d’organisation « logistique » ou « à mobilité résidentielle ». Le degré de « conservation ë au sein d’un ensemble lithique, interprété comme l’expression variable d’une attitude économe vis-à-vis de la matière première, constitue le lien entre la composition d’un ensemble lithique et un mode préférentiel d’exploitation du territoire. Nous appliquons notre méthodologie à l’étude de huit sites de l’Italie méridionale remontant au Pléistocène supérieur. En comparant les résultats tirés d’ensembles moustériens, uluzziens, proto-aurignaciens et épigravettiens, nous constatons que les trois premières industries semblent caractérisées par une similarité marquée en ce qui a trait à leur flexibilité techno-économique alors que l’Épigravettien apparaît défini par un modèle distinct d’exploitation du territoire, représentant vraisemblablement une adaptation aux climats plus rudes du dernier maximum glaciaire. Nous interprétons les résultats de cette approche dans le contexte de l’origine de l’homme moderne, mais soulignons que cette méthodologie peut aussi permettre d’identifier les modèles d’exploitation du territoire dans les sites stratifiés d’autres périodes et régions.}, number={2}, journal={American Antiquity}, author={Riel-Salvatore, Julien and Barton, C.
